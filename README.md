# HealthCare-Management-System

## Welcome!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to our Hospital Management System. We've built this to make managing hospitals easier and more organized. Let's break it down for you.

## What's Inside?

### 1. Database Magic ✨

We created a special database to store all the hospital info neatly. Imagine it like a giant digital file cabinet where we keep everything – patient records, doctor details, and much more.

### 2. Web App Wonder 🌐

Ever wanted to see all your hospital info at a glance? That's what the web app is for! Open `src/` to peek into the code that makes it all work. It's like having a superhero tool for managing hospitals.

### 3. Let's Set It Up! 🚀

- **Step 1:** Get a copy of our superhero system on your computer. Use `git clone` (don't worry, it's easy).
- **Step 2:** Magic time! Run `create_database.sql` to set up the database. It's like creating a special place to store our digital stuff.
- **Step 3:** Customize a bit. Open `config/config.json` and tell the system where your database is.
- **Step 4:** Install the secret powers (dependencies) with `npm install`.
- **Step 5:** Activate the superhero mode with `npm start`.

## What We Aimed For

Our goal? To make hospitals work like a well-oiled machine:

- **Everything in One Place:** All the hospital info neatly organized.
- **Super Easy to Use:** The web app is like a friendly guide for managing hospital stuff.
- **Less Mistakes:** We wanted to reduce errors and make sure the info is spot-on.
- **Happy Patients:** Imagine a hospital visit with no hiccups – that's what we're aiming for!
