# HealthCare-Management-System


## Overview

Welcome to our Hospital Management System project! This system aims to streamline hospital operations, providing an organized platform for managing patient information, appointments, billing, and more. This README will guide you through what we did, how we did it, and the results we achieved.


## Database Design and Implementation

We designed a comprehensive relational database to store hospital-related data. The SQL script for creating the database, including tables for hospitals, departments, doctors, nurses, patients, medical records, tests, medications, billing, and more, is available in `database_scripts/create_database.sql`.


## Patient Information Management

Efficient management of patient information is a core feature of the system. It includes functionalities for handling patient records, medical history, testing, medications, and billing.

## Billing and Financial Management

The system incorporates features for billing and financial management. It tracks and manages financial transactions related to patient services, providing transparency and accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
